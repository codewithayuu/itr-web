## üö® Forking this repo
People have contacted me asking if they can use this code for their website. Usually, the answer is yes, as long as they give **proper credit**. I believe in keeping my site **open source**, but I want to discourage **plagiarism**. It's disheartening when people copy others' work without acknowledging the original developer. I myself put a lot of effort into building and designing this version of my website, and I'm proud of it! I only ask that you don't claim this work as your own. Thank you for visiting my portfolio! And if you find it helpful, please give this repository a star. ‚≠ê
